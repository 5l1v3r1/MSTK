exoatt is a utility to read in a _SERIAL_ Exodus II mesh and augment it
with real valued attributes read from an auxiliary file and write out
a new Exodus II mesh containing those attributes.

Run 'exoatt' as follows:

usage: exoatt <--partition=y|1|n|0> <--partition-method=0|1|2> <--parallel-check=y|1|n|0> infilename attfilename <outfilename>

partition-method = 0, METIS
                 = 1, ZOLTAN with GRAPH partioning
                 = 2, ZOLTAN with RCB partitioning
Choose 2 if you want to avoid partitioning models
with high aspect ratio along the short directions

infilename   = Input Exodus II File
attfilename  = Auxiliary file with real valued attributes
outfilename  = Output Exodus II file name


FORMAT of attfilename
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

attfilename can be anything, there is no requirement that it be
something.att or something.txt etc. The format is as follows:

---------------------------------------------------
number_of_attributes
attname1   entitytype   num_specified 
attrib_data_line_1
attrib_data_line_2
.
.
.
attname2   entitytype   num_specified
.
.
.
-----------------------------------------------------

attname is the attribute name

entitytype is keyword NODE, CELL

num_specified is the number of entities for which values are
specified. If it is -1, it means all entities of type entitytype in
the mesh.


The way an attribute data line is specified is different depending on
whether the values are specified on the whole mesh (num_specified =
-1) or on a subset (num_specified > 0). 

If values are specified on the whole mesh, then the attribute values
can be listed as is without any element IDs. There must be as many
values as there are entities of that type in the mesh.

If values are specified on a set of entities, then each attribute data
line must contain an entity ID followed by the value to assigned to
it.


NO COMMENT LINES ARE ALLOWED.
