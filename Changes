Changes v1.8

* Parallel Mesh functionality

Changes v1.71

* Fixes to import from Exodus file format

* Added MSets which are Mesh entity sets or named lists

* Exodus export routine

* DX export routine

* Bug fixes

Changes v1.7

* THE MSTKUTIL LIBS HAVE BEEN ABSORBED INTO MSTK. THERE IS NO NEED TO
  COMPILE MSTKUTIL AND MSTK SEPARATELY

* A major change was made to MESH_Rem_* routines. These cut the removal
  time of each mesh entity from O(n) to O(log(n)) with mesh renumbering 
  and O(1) without mesh renumbering. This should make mesh
  modification codes much faster

* Support for reduced representations has been added with on-the-fly 
  creation of virtual entities, automatic cleanup of virtual entities,
  and locking of virtual entities to avoid intermediate deletion.
 
  NOTE: THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED EXTENSIVELY SO SOME BUGS MAY EXIST

* Can read/write MSTK files in R1 format while the mesh is of type F1

* Support for VECTOR and TENSOR type attributes added

* Support for reading/writing attributes in MSTK files added


* Many bug fixes and efficiency improvements
