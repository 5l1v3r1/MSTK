I am enclosing gzipped, tarred files containing MSTK and MSTKutil sources 
version N.n. To use these, do the following

1. Unpack the sources by issuing the commands
     tar xvzf mstkutil.tar.gz   - creates directory mstkutil/N.n

2. cd to mstkutil/N.n

3. Type ./setup which will setup subdirs for compilation on i686 machines
running linux. For a different architecture, type ./setup archos, where
archos is the architecture and OS code for the system, e.g., ibm_aix9,
hp_ux10 etc.

4. Edit the Makefile to reflect the architecture and os specified to
setup. Edit the compiler and compiler flags. Also edit the TOPDIR to
reflect where the mstk and mstkutil directories are located. 

5. Type 'make' to make the debug version ./lib/$ARCHOS/libmstkutil-d.a 
and type 'make opt' to make the optimized version 
./lib/$ARCHOS/libmstkutil.a

6. Edit the 'install' file and modify the INSTALL_TOPDIR variable to
   be where you want the header files and include files to be
   installed. It could be $HOME or /usr/local. The script will install
   the header files in $INSTALL_TOPDIR/include/mstkutil-N.n. If you
   answer 'y' to the question "Do you to make the installed version
   the default?", it will make a symbolic link to it called $INSTALL_TOPDIR/include/mstkutil

7. Repeat step 1 to 6 with starting with unzipping and untarring mstk.tar.gz

8. Include "MSTK.h" in any code that uses MSTK

9. Include "-lmstk -lmstkutil" on the link line.


I have tested MSTK only on a Linux system with the gcc compiler. I do not 
see why it should not work on other systems with a ANSI compliant 
compiler. If it doesn't, please let me know. On other machines tar may
not support the -z option. In this case, gunzip the file first and
then issue a 'tar xvf file.tar' command.

Feel free to contact me if you need any assistance. Also, see the MSTK
website http://math.lanl.gov/~rao/Meshing-Projects/MSTK/
