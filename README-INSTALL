I am enclosing gzipped, tarred files containing MSTK sources 
version N.n. The following steps describe how to make, install and use
the MSTK and MSTutil libraries. In the descriptions, substitute N.n by
the major and minor version numbers of MSTK that you downloaded (for
example, 1.5).

*********************************************************************

It is no longer necessary to type setup to create the various object
file and library directories. The included make file will now detect
the architecture and os of your machine and create the necessary
directories

------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.      --------- Make install MSTK ----------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Unpack the sources by issuing the commands
     tar xvzf MSTK-N.n.tar.gz   - creates directories mstk-N.n

2. cd to mstk-N.n

3. Edit the Makefile to set the compiler and compiler flags (ONLY IF
   NECESSARY). In general, on a Linux system you have to make little
   or no change to the Makefile.

4. Also edit the TOPDIR variable in the Makefile to reflect where the
   mstk directories are located. For example, if the mstk directories 
   are in the directory $HOME/develop/, then set TOPDIR to $HOME/develop.

5. Type 'make' to make the debug and optimized versions of the
   libraries which are ./lib/$ARCHOS/libmstk-d.a and
   ./lib/$ARCHOS/libmstk.a respectively. 

	To include the mesh partitioning code MESH_Partition with
	METIS, you have to type 'make PAR=1'

6. Edit the 'install' file and modify the INSTALL_TOPDIR variable to
   be where you want the header files and include files to be
   installed. It could be $HOME or /usr/local. 

   Then type 'install N.n' (e.g., 'install 1.5')

   The script will install the header files in
   $INSTALL_TOPDIR/include/mstk-N.n. If you answer 'y' to the
   question "Do you to make the installed version the default?", it
   will make a symbolic link to it called
   $INSTALL_TOPDIR/include/mstk


------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.      --------- Use MSTK for code development ----------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Read the manual !!!!! It is in .../mstk-N.n/docs/

2. Include "MSTK.h" in any code that uses MSTK

3. Edit the makefile to indicate the paths to MSTK libraries. 
   If necessary, also indicate where the metis library paths are.

4. Include "-lmstk" on the link line for the optimized libs and 
   "-lmstk-d" for the debug libs




NOTES:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The make file arguments have changed in this version of MSTK. Now just
typing 'make' will make the debug and optimized versions - No need to
type 'make' and 'make opt' separately. 'make PAR=1' will include the
mesh partitioning routines and you must link with METIS

I have tested MSTK only on a Linux system with the gcc compiler. I do not 
see why it should not work on other systems with a ANSI compliant 
compiler. If it doesn't, please let me know. On other machines tar may
not support the -z option. In this case, gunzip the file first and
then issue a 'tar xvf file.tar' command.

Feel free to contact me if you need any assistance. Also, see the MSTK
website http://math.lanl.gov/~rao/Meshing-Projects/MSTK/
