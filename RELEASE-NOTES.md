MSTK v3.1.1

Clearly this README is being updated after a long time. The big improvements in this version are

1. A new serial->parallel partitioning option in the library and the meshconvert utility
2. Preserve existing global IDs for parallel mesh read or serial mesh partitioning
3. No need for clients to define MSTK_HAVE_MPI. If its built with MPI, this will be defined


04/06/2016
MSTK v2.26rc1

* Fixed a "bug" in the FLAG X3D writer. Apparently the matnames field in the file must only be string version of integers. Misunderstanding by some legacy code a long time ago and the tradition has stuck.
* Minor fixup in MESH_Update1Attribute
'chkmesh' now reads meshes in any of the importable formats

02/07/2015
MSTK v2.25

* Fixed up the parallel import/export of FLAG X3D files
* Incorporated utility to generate structured meshes (mkstruc)
* Added functionality to exchange attributes on entities that have 1-1 mapping on parallel boundaries (faces in 3D, edges in 2D)
* Added functionality to do gather-scatter operation on attributes on entities that have many-to-one mapping on parallel boundaries (vertices in 2D, vertices and edges in 3D)
* Added new operator to query if entity is on parallel boundary
* Removed use of MSTK_malloc, MSTK_calloc, MSTK_realloc and MSTK_free
* Added call that will invert knowledge about which processors will send a processor data to figure out what processors it needs to send data to
* Use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as installlation directory if INSTALL_DIR is not defined
* Other bug fixes

11/23/2015
MSTK 2.25 rc1

* Added capability to write out vector fields (component by component) to Exodus II meshes
* Added capability to read scalar and vector fields (component by component and aggregated) from Exodus II meshes

10/23/2015
MSTK 2.24

* Fixed some minor bugs in interpretation of natt argument in MESH_ExportToGMV
* Fixed tests to specify the Exodus II format as exodusii instead of exo"
* Bug fix in MFs_Join
* Added unit test for getting the dihedral angle between two mesh faces

6/26/2015
MSTK 2.24rc1

* Added routine MRs_Join to joint two mesh regions along a common face
* MESH_ImportToFile and MESH_ExportToFile enhanced to figure out format from file extension if format is given as NULL
* MESH_ExportToGMV will not write out special MSTK attributes vidatt, ridatt etc.

5/8/2015
MSTK 2.23

* MAJOR: Enhanced the exoatt utility to read text file with element and side set info and introduce them into the mesh
* MINOR: Some tweaks to Exodus II export routine including an option to not renumber vertices to ensure contiguous IDs

5/5/2015
MSTK v2.23rc2

* MAJOR: Added capability to read/write elements sets from/to Exodus II files
* MINOR: Eliminated hash table while reading Exodus II files, freed some memory during mesh partitioning, not checking topological consistency automatically during meshconvert

3/30/2015
MSTK v2.23rc1

* Fixed an input parsing error and added option to recognize .par for output extensions

1/13/2015
MSTK v2.22

* Install utilities such as meshconvert in INSTALL_DIR/bin if specified or in the bin directory under the project source
* Restore MSTK_UpdateAttr call temporarily for backward compatibility but with a warning in DEBUG mode

12/8/2014
MSTK v2.22 rc4

* Major changes to mesh partitioning code to interleave data collection with MPI communication for greater efficiency
* On some machines (mustang at LANL), we see dramatic decreases in partitioning time (4 times faster) but on others (edison.nersc.gov) it is showing a slight increase. This may be due to differences in MPI latency.

11/26/2014
MSTK v2.22 rc3

* Fixed a bug in the restructured code for MESH_ExportToExodusII

11/25/2014
MSTK v2.22 rc2

* Fixed a SERIOUS bug in parallel partitioning that showed up only on machines with high MPI latency
* More specifically, fixed a serious flaw in MESH_SendMesh where I was using a statically declared array inside a routine to do a buffered send but was waiting for all buffered sends to complete outside the routine.
**IF YOU CARE ABOUT PARALLEL PARTITIONING, DO NOT USE ANY VERSION PRIOR TO THIS - THEY MAY WORK, BUT IT IS NOT GUARANTEED**

11/21/2014
MSTK v2.22 rc1

* Added a new utility 'exoatt' to import an Exodus II mesh, augment it with attributes read from a file and export it back out, possibly partitioning it in the process.
* As part of the above, added ability to export real valued attributes as properties to Exodus II files
* Fixed some serious bugs lurking in MESH_CopyAttr (I don't think it ever worked before)

09/08/2014
MSTK v2.21

* Improve efficiency of MESH_Delete
* Improve efficiency of MESH_CopySet in parallel distribution
* Both result in significant improvement in performance of parallel distribution
* Fixed bug in creation of element sets for surface meshes imported from Exodus II files

09/05/2014

* A minor change to MESH_RecvMesh to used non-blocking receives to the extent possible
* Small improvement in performance

09/03/2014

* Some minor fixes to how an empty communicator is checked

09/02/2014

* MSTK_Mesh_Distribute, MESH_Partition function arguments changed to allow caller to ask for deletion of input mesh shortly after partitioning
* MSTK_Send* and MESH_Send* function arguments modified to send back pending MPI requests as well as pointers to memory allocated. This allows code to defer the blocking call after sending mesh information.

06/07/2014

**NOTE: This is a backward INCOMPATIBLE release if you use mesh modification functions in MSTK**
* Added argument to ME_Collapse routines to return list of deleted entities (API change)

08/21/2013
MSTK v 2.10 rc1

* Had to bump up minor revision number because of change in arguments of one public function MESH_BuildClassification
* MESH_BuildClassification now takes use_geometry argument indicating
if it should refine the mesh classification based on expensive geometric checks
* 'meshconvert' now accepts --classify=2 in addition to 1 to indicate
that it should do these more expensive classification checks. If the option is --classify=1, mesh classification will be computed based only on topological information
* Import from Nemesis I files now discards the global IDs in nemesis files
which can be discontinuous on a processor. Instead it recomputes them.
* ParallelCheck checks for contiguous global IDs on a processor

05/20/2013
MSTK v 2.02 release candidate 2

Added the file MSTKConfig.cmake.in that is essential for writing out the options and TPLs that MSTK is configured with into the MSTK install dir. It was claimed that this option was available in MSTK 2.01 but since this file was omitted the configuration file was not being written out.

If you want to use the MSTK configuration file to simplify building of MSTK based applications, use this version

05/14/2013
MSTK v 2.02 release candidate 1

NOTE 5/21/2013: There was an error in this push. I forgot to add MSTKConfig.cmake.in As a result, the configuration files were not being written

03/22/2013

NOTE 5/21/2013: There was an error in this push. I forgot to add MSTKConfig.cmake.in As a result, the configuration files were not being written

* Set parallel adjacency status flag to stale when entities are removed from the mesh
* Set parallel adjacency status flag to current after calling MESH_Update_ParallelAdj
* Check Parallel Ajdacency flag before updating attributes and if it is stale, call MESH_Update_ParallelAdj
